## Required Homework/Tasks

I followed the instructions on the [AWS CLI Install Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip

### Create a Budget

Watching this video, [Creating Budget via CLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdUnNuKylHg&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=14) provided by the instructor, I created my own Budget to track my monthly spend as well as my AWS credits. I cannot afford to spend more than I have. 

I created just 2 budgets not to go over the free-tier limit.
